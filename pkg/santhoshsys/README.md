# JSONSchema based kindsys

This is a very simple kindsys implementation based on https://github.com/santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema

This will construct a validation system based on a set of jsonschema files in a file system.

This is not (yet?) intended to be a real implementation -- the goal is just to show that 
alternative approaches to meet the core contracts are not dramatically difficult.
